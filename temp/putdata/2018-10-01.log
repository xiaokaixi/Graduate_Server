Gen 1:1 At the first God made the heaven and the earth.
Gen 1:2 And the earth was waste and without form; and it was dark on the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters.
Gen 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Gen 1:4 And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark,
Gen 1:5 Naming the light, Day, and the dark, Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
Gen 1:6 And God said, Let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters, parting the waters from the waters.

Gen 1:8 And God gave the arch the name of Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

Gen 1:15 And let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.
Gen 1:16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to be the ruler of the day, and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night: and he made the stars.
Gen 1:17 And God put them in the arch of heaven, to give light on the earth;
Gen 1:18 To have rule over the day and the night, and for a division between the light and the dark: and God saw that it was good.
Gen 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
Gen 1:20 And God said, Let the waters be full of living things, and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven.

Gen 1:28 And God gave them his blessing and said to them, Be fertile and have increase, and make the earth full and be masters of it; be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth.
Gen 1:29 And God said, See, I have given you every plant producing seed, on the face of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit producing seed: they will be for your food:
Gen 1:30 And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth I have given every green plant for food: and it was so.
Gen 1:31 And God saw everything which he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Gen 2:2 And on the seventh day God came to the end of all his work; and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done.
Gen 2:3 And God gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy: because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done.
Gen 2:4 These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made.
Gen 2:5 In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth, and no grass had come up: for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land.

Gen 2:10 And a river went out of Eden giving water to the garden; and from there it was parted and became four streams.
Gen 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon, which goes round about all the land of Havilah where there is gold.
Gen 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
Gen 2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: this river goes round all the land of Cush.
Gen 2:14 And the name of the third river is Tigris, which goes to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
Gen 2:15 And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it.

Gen 2:17 But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it, death will certainly come to you.

Gen 2:19 And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing, that was its name.
Gen 2:20 And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help.
Gen 2:21 And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man, and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping, joining up the flesh again in its place:
Gen 2:22 And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman, and took her to the man.
Gen 2:23 And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man.
Gen 2:24 For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.
Gen 2:25 And the man and his wife were without clothing, and they had no sense of shame.
Gen 3:1 Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden?
Gen 3:2 And the woman said, We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden:
Gen 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, If you take of it or put your hands on it, death will come to you.
Gen 3:4 And the snake said, Death will not certainly come to you:
Gen 3:5 For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit, your eyes will be open, and you will be as gods, having knowledge of good and evil.
Gen 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and a delight to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and gave it to her husband.
Gen 3:7 And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together.

Gen 3:9 And the voice of the Lord God came to the man, saying, Where are you?
Gen 3:10 And he said, Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear, because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes.
Gen 3:11 And he said, Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing? Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take?
Gen 3:12 And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it.
Gen 3:13 And the Lord God said to the woman, What have you done? And the woman said, I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it.
Gen 3:14 And the Lord God said to the snake, Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth, and dust will be your food all the days of your life:
Gen 3:15 And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded.
Gen 3:16 To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master.
Gen 3:17 And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life.
